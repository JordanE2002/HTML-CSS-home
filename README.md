I made a README.md file to list some issues/font changes/styles changes/ image changes etc.


Before I start the code is separated into separate css files for now to keep all the code orginised and easy to manage, aka footer is in footer.scss, header is in header.scss etc.





1.	The biggest issue I had is the dropbox/navbar bit I cannot get that to work properly for the life of me, but hopefully a few weeks away will give me a fresh look on how to make it properly.
2.	I know I need to change some styles/font/logos etc, from when I was in my testing stages, but I can fix those quite easily.
3.	I have been told that on some larger screens, some elements are not loaded correctly, but I do not have a screen bigger than the one I use (1920 x 1080 screen resolution) so if that is true, I don’t know what I can do to fix that if that is true.
4.	I know I need to change the partners/case studies width for media queries, but as I will be making them use java at some point, I don’t know how much that bit of code needs to change, so I have left it, as I don’t know if I have to do a whole rework of that code section, when I am introduced to java.
